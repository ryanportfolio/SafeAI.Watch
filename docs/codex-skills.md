# Maintaining Codex skills

The `native` entries in `.agents/skill-modes.json` declare workflows maintained directly
in `.agents/skills/<name>/`. These own their Codex instructions. The registry also supports
`adapter` and `disabled`; omitted names retain generated adapter behavior. A skill's source
ownership is separate from whether it requires agents or explicit authorization.

Native entries do not require a Claude counterpart. Existing `skillOverrides: off` settings
remain respected for compatibility. Move a maintained skill outside discovery explicitly
before disabling it. `writing-skills` and `unslop` entrypoints are retired in both runtimes.
Use `addskill` for create/import/update/install; it uses built-in `skill-creator` as the
Codex authoring mechanism.

## Repository changes

Read the existing skill and its references. Edit the source for the intended runtime;
preserve the other runtime unless its behavior is also in scope. Register new standalone
names and classify each active Codex skill in `.agents/CODEX-SKILL-COMPATIBILITY.md`.
Keep descriptions below 240 characters and the initial catalog within its checked budget.

Run:

```text
node .claude/scripts/sync-codex-skills.mjs --write
node .claude/scripts/sync-codex-skills.mjs --check
node .claude/scripts/test-codex-contract.mjs
node .claude/scripts/check-skill-capabilities.mjs
node --test .claude/scripts/test-skill-capabilities.mjs
node --test .claude/scripts/test-sync-codex-skills.mjs .claude/scripts/test-codex-skill-sync.mjs .claude/scripts/test-codex-skill-copies.mjs
```

Sync refuses missing or still-generated standalone entry points. It preserves handwritten
content and never silently replaces it with a pointer. Validate referenced resources and
meaningful decision scenarios separately; metadata checks cannot establish workflow quality.

## Personal copies

The repository standalone skill is the distribution source. Personal customizations must
be reconciled explicitly rather than overwritten. Only install into the requested discovery
root; never create copies in multiple roots by default. Same-named copies can be independently
discoverable, so a matching name is not proof that the intended version was loaded.

1. Inspect the actual personal path and compare its contents with the repository source.
2. Resolve material differences within the user's scope. Preserve explicit user preferences.
3. Before replacing an existing file, back it up outside the skill discovery directory and
   record its original path and hash. Check it has not changed since inspection.
4. Copy the approved skill and required supporting resources. Preserve unrelated personal
   files. Verify source and destination bytes; report the backup location.
5. Verify the intended path in the target client after reload. Do not claim that editing
   files proves a running session has loaded the new instructions.

Use the read-only drift check against explicitly named roots:

```text
node .claude/scripts/check-codex-skill-copies.mjs <personal-skills-root>
```

It compares existing copies of registered standalone skills and required source resources;
it installs nothing and treats extra destination files as possible customizations. Comparisons
use exact bytes, including line endings. Links and unreadable resources are reported as
unverified while other copies are still checked. It does not scan chats, change settings,
or automatically publish updates. A restore uses the
recorded backup after verifying the exact destination and intervening changes.

Repository edits, personal installation, and Git publication are separate scopes. An
authorization can cover several, but completing one does not implicitly authorize the rest.

## Coverage and selective propagation

`.agents/skill-capabilities.json` declares intended coverage, owners, entrypoints, required
tools/resources, shared acceptance contracts and justified runtime exceptions. The validator
checks coverage independently of what the generator happens to discover. Tools are runtime
requirements to inspect at execution time; this file does not grant them or prove availability.
Its resource list retains packaged optional references and licenses, and local Markdown links
are checked separately. Shared contract labels record intended semantics; structural checks
cannot prove that an agent follows them.

Explicit registry disables and legacy `skillOverrides: off` suppress expected Codex discovery
without erasing intended coverage from the manifest. A maintained native entrypoint must be
moved outside discovery explicitly before disabling it; required supporting resources remain.
The validator rejects a disabled entrypoint that reappears. An unexplained missing Claude or
enabled Codex entrypoint still fails.

Update the manifest deliberately with source changes. Run the validator with `--write` to
refresh the catalog below, then run it without arguments to check for drift. Retired routes
cannot retain SKILL.md in either root. A deliberate single-runtime capability requires an
explicit coverage list and a nonempty exception explaining the omission.

For selective updates, inspect the diff before choosing paths:

```text
git diff HEAD starter/main -- .agents/skills/<name> .agents/skill-modes.json .agents/skill-capabilities.json
git checkout starter/main -- .agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md .agents/skills/<name>/references/<resource>
```

Merge selected registry entries from `git show starter/main:.agents/skill-modes.json` and
the capability manifest; preserve unrelated entries and explicit disabled choices. Never
replace a customized kernel or `.claude/reference/` as a side effect. Reconcile changed
resources with their native body before regenerating adapters and running the checks above.
An inherited `"writing-skills": "disabled"` entry may remain as an inert migration
record; retired names cannot use native/adapter ownership or regain a SKILL.md entrypoint.
For this migration, explicitly remove `.agents/skills/unslop/SKILL.md` and
`.claude/skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md`, plus any retired counterpart left by a
partial sync, and drop the `unslop` ownership entry before regeneration. Checkout
does not remove paths absent upstream. Inspect and back up customizations first,
preserving useful behavior in replacements or outside discovery; keep resources
and licenses. Validate that neither retired name has a SKILL.md in either root.
The isolated Git fixture exercises this sequence without fetching a remote or changing a
real project. It proves selective file adoption and preserved customization, not publication.
