# changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
this project aims at [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Version boundaries before 1.2.0 are reconstructed from git history rather than
release tags, so the grouping is approximate. Anything older than 1.0.0 is
condensed.

## [Unreleased]

### Removed

- The `merge` skill leaves the template. Session-wide auto-merge is a personal
  authorization policy, not a repository one, so it now lives as a global skill in
  `~/.claude/skills/merge`. The kernel's squash-by-default and one-PR-per-unit rules
  are unchanged.

### Changed

- `refine` gates edits on three checks before changing anything: the failure is
  attributable to an instruction, tool, or configuration; the causal link is stated from
  evidence; and the rule being changed was active in the failure. It also checks what the
  agent saw and remembered before blaming instructions. Informed by ModularRSI's
  failure-mode checklist, in original wording.
- Evidence workflows package compact reports and comparable before/after presentation.
  Design, planning and review workflows add selective shared-code refactoring guidance
  for Claude and Codex, with standalone resources and existing authorization preserved.
- Skill authoring now starts with `addskill`; `writing-skills` discovery is retired
  with authoring resources and licenses preserved. Caveman includes Unslop, with
  explicit prose and code cleanup retained after standalone Unslop retirement.
- Claude and Codex workflows align evidence, independent review, authorization,
  runtime discovery and selective native propagation. Claude gains `perf-loop`.
- Capability coverage, resources, ownership and retirement now have a manifest
  and regression checks. Older disabled retirement entries remain compatible;
  startup and contributor guidance follow the consolidated routes.
- Existing projects receive explicit retirement migration steps, a native Codex
  drift reminder, and optional-settings compatibility in copy and README tooling.

- `writing` skill: pattern 31 carries the Latinate-dress-up trap table
  from Corewise.Academy `plain-words` (prohibition → ban, verbatim →
  word-for-word, and so on) plus the what-never-changes list; the
  plain-words rule in SKILL.md names the swaps. Pattern 5 labels its
  After text as citing a source the writer already had, so the example
  no longer reads as permission to invent one.

### Added

- `long-horizon-workflows` skill: the `long-horizon` contract with each round's
  baseline, executor, inspector and judges run as one Workflow script, so audit
  agents cannot inherit Manager context, verdicts are schema enums, and the run
  journal records every agent's input and output. Judge count is chosen per round.
  Claude Code only; Codex keeps `long-horizon`.
- `scripts/lib/launch-chrome.mjs`: headed Chrome launcher that puts the
  window on a display the operator is not using and hands the keyboard
  back, so the real-GPU browser rule stops interrupting them.
- `refine` skill: post-task pass that mines the session for friction and
  commits the smallest edit that prevents a repeat (concept port of
  prime-agent's Continual Harness).
- `long-horizon` skill: Manager/Executor/Auditor rounds with audit-gated
  durable state for tasks bigger than one context window (concept port of
  AMAP-ML's LongHorizon-Harness).
- `writing` skill: one skill for text that leaves the session (docs,
  READMEs, site and UI copy, emails) and for editing or auditing a draft
  for AI tells. Adds the rhetoric patterns from petergyang/no-ai-slop
  (throat-clearing openers, faux-insight setups, colon reveals, kickers)
  and its edit-mode restraint (minimum effective edit, keep real hedges).

### Changed

- Codex planning, review, authorization, and recovery workflows have clearer scope and
  verification rules. `addskill` and `fable-mode` now have native bodies registered in
  `.agents/skill-modes.json`. Claude workflows and existing disabled choices are preserved.
- A read-only copy checker detects drift in explicitly selected personal skill roots;
  maintenance documentation covers backup, reconciliation, and discovery checks.

- `README.md`: the safety model section became "what's different here", the
  template's differentiators; the safety rules moved to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  beside the PR checklist that enforces them.
- `CLAUDE.md`, `caveman`, `session-start.sh`: the always-on core-tells
  digest now points at `writing/patterns.md` instead of the removed
  `unslop` skill.

### Removed

- `humanizer`, `purposeful-writing`, `unslop` skills and the
  `bootstrap/machine/home-claude/skills/writing` copy, folded into
  `writing`. The always-on digest in `CLAUDE.md` and `caveman` is
  unchanged.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-25

### Changed

- Renamed the project to **Harness Firmware**. The name describes what the
  layer configures: the agent harness (Claude Code, Codex), not a model. The
  repository URL is unchanged. Machine identifiers (plugin `name`, skill
  namespaces) are unchanged so existing installs keep working.
- Restructured `README.md` around what the layer is, how to install it, and
  what it costs to keep loaded.
- `/init-project` now asks which prose mode a project wants instead of assuming
  silently. `caveman ultra` remains the inherited default; `lite`, `full`, and
  `normal` are one answer away, and `README.md` documents changing it later.
  The skill also offers a minimal skill preset for projects that want a small
  always-loaded surface.

### Added

- POSIX bootstrap script, so setup works from a plain shell without PowerShell.
- `doctor.mjs`, a preflight check for a checkout: the SessionStart hook is
  wired, skill frontmatter parses, generated Codex adapters are in sync, the
  reference library is complete, plugin manifests parse, no `FILL IN` markers
  survived, and the always-loaded context weight is reported.
- Community files: `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and GitHub issue
  templates for bug reports and skill proposals.

### Fixed

- Frontmatter parsers in `sync-codex-skills.mjs` and `test-codex-contract.mjs`
  did not recognize `>-` block scalars, which made the `perf` skill
  undiscoverable in Codex and hid its description-length violation from CI.
  Both parsers are fixed and the `perf` description now fits the 240-char
  contract limit.

## [1.1.3]

### Fixed

- `/sync-starter` guards the spawn-critical surface (`bootstrap/`,
  `.claude/hooks/`, `settings.json`) from direct-to-main commits and ships the
  post-squash branch re-sync fix to plugin installs.

## [1.1.2]

### Added

- `perf` skill: a measurement rig for web performance work, so changes to
  bundling, preload hints, and lazy loading get measured instead of assumed.
- Steering levers adopted from `mattpocock/skills` across the core skills.
- PASS/FAIL verdict step in the `writing` skill.
- The global `writing` skill is now tracked by the home-claude bootstrap.

### Fixed

- The `merge` skill re-syncs the session branch after each squash merge, so a
  commit pushed after a merge is no longer stranded off `main`.
- The bootstrap `writing` skill is ASCII-only, which unbreaks validation on
  `main`.
- Restored the squash-merge default and the one-open-PR reuse rule in the
  `merge` skill.

### Changed

- `CLAUDE.md` allows plan-mode popups (`ExitPlanMode`, `AskUserQuestion`).

## [1.1.0]

### Added

- Unified project generator for spawning a configured repo.
- Visual project creator UI (`new-claude-project-ui`).
- Codex hardening for spawned projects: `AGENTS.md` owns Codex runtime safety
  and tool translation, and generated adapters live in `.agents/skills/`.
- Pitfall entry: verify local preview servers before trusting them.

### Changed

- Trimmed the `CLAUDE.md` kernel down to cross-cutting rules; topical detail
  moved to `.claude/reference/`.
- Pointed template references at the renamed repository.

## [1.0.0]

### Added

- `fable-mode` skill for layered work with dependent steps and
  verification-sensitive handoff.
- `purposeful-writing` skill, folding in the best of `humanizer`.

### Fixed

- `addskill` lands a new skill on `main` via the merge flow instead of leaving
  it on a branch.

## [0.x]

Earlier history condensed: the initial kernel, the on-demand skill system,
committed project memory under `.claude/reference/`, session hooks, the Codex
skill sync scripts, and the first pass at context-weight accounting.
